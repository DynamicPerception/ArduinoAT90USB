AT90USB64x/128x Support Files for Arduino
=========================================

These files provide everything you need to build software for the AT90USB64x and AT90USB128x series of microcontrollers from Atmel.  The AT90 series microcontrollers have built-in USB and USB OTG support, with the 64x having 64KB of flash space and the 128x having 128KB of flash space.  These low-cost microcontrollers are an excellent substition for those projects that need additional flash and SRAM at a lower cost than the ATMega2560.

In Arduino 1.5.x, you'll also get complete access to the wonderful LUFA Libraries by Dean Camera.  You can use these libraries directly inside of Arduino IDE when using 1.5.x versions of the Arduino IDE. (Latest "nightly" build is suggested, 1.5.2 is not suggested.)

Installation Instructions (Arduino < 1.5)
-------------------------

1. Copy all files in Arduino-1.x/ into the hardware/arduino directory inside of the Arduino application folder
2. Re-start Arduino if already running
3. Select correct board type 

Installation Instructions (Arduino >= 1.5.2)
-------------------------

1. Copy the contents of the Arduino-1.5/hardware directory into the hardware/ directory inside of the Arduino application folder
2. Re-start Arduino if already running
3. Select correct board type
